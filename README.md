   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

To use the models and scripts in this repository, follow these instructions:

1. Load your encrypted text data.
2. Utilize the provided scripts to decode intentions and analyze the data.

Example command:
```bash
python decode.py --input your_encrypted_file.txt
```

## Examples

Here are some examples of how to use the scripts:

- **Example 1**: Decoding a sample encrypted text.
- **Example 2**: Analyzing intentions from a dataset.

Refer to the `examples/` directory for detailed scripts and datasets.
